### ðŸš§ Apps (In Progress)

A few interactive visualizations and mini-tools will eventually be hosted via [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/):

- ðŸŒ¼ Species gallery
- ðŸ§­ Seed tracking / mapping
- ðŸ“ˆ Observation dashboard

Right now, this is still in the brainstorm phase â€” nothing public yet.
